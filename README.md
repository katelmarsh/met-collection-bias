This is the repo for Kate Marsh's project titled "Analyzing the Highlighted Art Pieces and Possible Biases at the Metropolitan Art Museum". 

The  goal of this project is to predict the isHighlight variable and use it to reveal biases in the Met's decision making of what is an important or non-important work. Using features such as the department of the work (eg. Egyptian Art), the culture of the art, the artist's demographics, the artist nationality, medium, dimensions, country created in, region, and general classification.
